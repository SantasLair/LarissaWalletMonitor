# About Larissa Wallet Monitor
This app makes API calls to your wallets using your Bearer Token so that its easier to monitor all of your wallet balances at once.
Your bearer token stays on your system where you run this app and is never shared with anyone.
The source code is open for all under the MIT license.

Please note, the name of this repo may change once I think of cool name for it :)

# Develpment is in progress
While this app is functional during development, it is not completed.
I will post instructions here once I have finished version 1 of development.
